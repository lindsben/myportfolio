          I am a student at the University of Central Florida. I am working
          towards a Bachelor's degree in Digital Media on the web design track.
          I have always had a strong passion for art and technology and the
          world of web design perfectly implements both. In school, I have
          learned numerous coding languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP,
          MYSQL, React, and React Native. As for my career, my goal is to one
          day work as a developer for Spotify.

              The purpose of this project was to put my wireframe skills to use
              by creating my own version of a To-Do List app. I utilized my
              skills in Figma and my knowledge of React while creating this
              wireframe. One problem I encountered while creating this was
              coming up with a pleasant color scheme that goes along with the
              purpose of the app. I solved this by researching different color
              palettes and the emotional effects of certain colors. By doing
              this, I was able to come up with a simple palette that went along
              perfectly with my app wireframe.

              The purpose of this project was to utilize my knowledge of React
              by creating the mechanics of an exercise app. I would say that the
              main problem I was faced with when creating this mock up app was
              creating the screen components. I had never coded something like
              that before so it was definitely something to get used to. I did
              so by reading about React online to allow myself to become more
              knowledgable of the coding language as a whole.

              The purpose of this project was to once again utilize my skills
              and knowedge of Figma and React Native to create a wireframe for a
              Study Cards app. The main issue I had with this project was
              figuring out how to fit all of the components together on each
              screen while keeping the wireframe cohesive. Through trial and
              error, I was able to persevere past my struggles. I am really
              proud of my wireframe design for this project. I decided to make
              the wireframe a combination of a pretty blue and green color. I
              felt that these colors were perfect for an app that is "studious"
              in nature. I kept the fonts simple as well because I did not want
              to distract the user from why they are using the app, which is to
              study.

              their grade at the end of the quiz. One issue I was faced with was
              figuring out how to code a multiple-answer question. Having to
              figure out how to make my code recognize the user input was
              another problem I was faced with, but in the end, I was able to
              figure it out through trial and error.

              entertaining to make my own version of the type of app I use on a
              day-to-day basis. I decided to use colors lighter in nature
              because I wanted the user to feel a sort of "uplifting" feeling if
              they were to use my app.
